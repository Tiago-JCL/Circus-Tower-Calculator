# Circus-Tower-Calculator
 Hi! I'm studying Python, and here i'm making a Circus Tower Defense(from Roblox) tower calculator! 

## Instalation
 For this project to work on your machine, need to install its dependencies:
 ```
 pip install tkinter
 ```
 ```
 pip install customtkinter
 ```
 ```
 pip install Pillow
 ```

## Using
 The project is still in early stages so its not executable at the moment
 It'll use customtkinter for the interface, the focus is for making something like this:

<img src="./imgs/tela_menu.png" alt="Menu" width = 250px>
<img src="./imgs/tela_lua.png" alt="Moon" width = 250px>
